# Brief Report

## Overview
This portfolio showcases projects, skills, and background. It’s built with semantic HTML, responsive CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (mobile nav, carousel, and form validation). Deployed to Vercel.

## Features
- Mobile-friendly layout and hamburger navigation
- Accessible project carousel
- Client-side form validation
- Consistent theme and typography

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Styling polish:** Switched to a cohesive blue/cyan theme with glass panels for better visual hierarchy while maintaining high contrast and reduced-motion support.
- **Carousel responsiveness:** Added a resize handler to recalc slide width.
- **Paths/hosting:** Used relative paths for universal hosting compatibility.
